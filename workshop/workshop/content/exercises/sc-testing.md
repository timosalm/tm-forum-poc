**Persona: Operators**

The **first step** in the path to production watches the in the Workload configured repository with the source-code for new commits and makes the source-code available for the following steps as an archive via HTTP. [Flux](https://fluxcd.io) is part of TAP for this functionality, but as with any other tool we provide with TAP it can be easily replaced by an alternative.

After that the **Tekton Pipline**, we applied in the role of the development team in a previous step, will be automatically executed for the provided source-code via an Tekton integration that detects our pipeline based on the `apps.tanzu.vmware.com/pipeline: test`.
