**Persona: Developers**

The Tanzu Developer Tools IDE extension enables developers to rapidly iterate on their applications on a production like environment - which is easy to provide with TAP.

This extension enables developers to:
- Generate snippets to quickly create TAP configuration files
- Live update workloads directly onto TAP-enabled Kubernetes cluster
- Debug workloads directly on TAP-enabled Kubernetes clusters

**Code snippets** enable you to quickly add the files necessary to develop against TAP to existing projects by creating a template in an empty file which you fill out with the required information. 

```editor:execute-command
command: vscode.openFolder
args:
- "~/tmf-product-catalog-management-api-java"
```

Let's first try out the **live update functionality**. 
[Tilt](https://tilt.dev) is used behind the scence and a configuration file for it (Tiltfile) was generated by Application Accelerator as part of our project template. 
If you've never used Tilt before, this script may seem like a lot. Let's kick it off, and then we'll talk through what it's doing. You can right click on the Tiltfile in the code editor, and select `Tanzu: Live Update Start` in the pop-up menu. **Or**, you can click on the command below to accomplish the same thing.

```editor:execute-command
command: tanzu.liveUpdateStart
```

The Tiltfile script is going to deploy our application into our development environment, and it will take about 2.5 minutes to run to completion the first time. But don't worry! It is setting us up to run iterative deployments that will be much, much faster.

This code change will automatically trigger a patch to the running container. In under 10 seconds, you'll see the application restart in the terminal window. Go to the browser tab where your application is running, and refresh it. You'll see the code changes applied.
```dashboard:open-url
url: https://product-catalog-management-api-java-{{ session_namespace }}.cnr.{{ ENV_TAP_INGRESS }}
```

To start **debugging** on the cluster:
1. Add a breakpoint in your code.
2. Right-click the workload.yaml file in your project.
3. Select Tanzu: Java Debug Start in the right-click menu.
