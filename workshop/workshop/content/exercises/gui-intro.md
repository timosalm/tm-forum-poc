**Persona: Developers**

VMware Tanzu Application Platform also provides a developer portal (TAP GUI) that provides a central location in which we can view dependencies, relationships, technical documentation, and even the service status.

It's based on the Cloud Native Computing Foundationâ€™s project **Backstage** and packages together several capabilities of the Backstage OSS ecosystem together with some commercial functionailites in an easy consumable way.

We already talked about the **App Accelerators** which are part of TAP GUI. 
TAP GUI provides several other capabilities which we will discover now.
