**Learning Center for Tanzu Application Platform** provides a platform for creating and self-hosting workshops. 

It allows content creators to create workshops from markdown files that are displayed to the learner in a **terminal shell environment** with an **instructional wizard UI**. 

The UI can **embed slide content**, an **integrated development environment (IDE)**, a **web console for accessing the Kubernetes cluster**, and other custom web applications.

Although Learning Center requires Kubernetes to run, and is used to teach users about Kubernetes, you can use it to host training for other purposes as well.

As we will use Learning Center today to show you the capabilites of VMware Tanzu Application, it could be used to enable developers and also operaters to use and operator the platform.
