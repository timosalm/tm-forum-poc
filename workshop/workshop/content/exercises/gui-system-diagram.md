**Persona: Developers**

The **Organization Catalog** is a centralized system that keeps track of ownership and metadata for all the software in our ecosystem (services, websites, libraries, data pipelines, etc). The catalog is built around the concept of **metadata files stored together with the code**, which are then harvested and visualized.

It enables **two main use-cases**:
- Helping teams manage and maintain the software they own.
- Makes all the software in our organisation, and who owns it, discoverable.

Let's have a look hwo that looks like for our use-case:
