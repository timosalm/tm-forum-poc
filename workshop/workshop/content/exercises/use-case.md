TM Forum’s 60+ REST-based Open APIs are developed collaboratively by TM Forum members working in our Open API project. They are now **widely adopted by the industry**, with more than 500,000 downloads by 32,000 software developers from 2,300 organizations including Vodafone.

The **Product Catalog Management API (TMF620)** was chosen as an example of TM Forum Open API specification for this demonstration of the value VMware Tanzu Application Platform provides to Vodafone.
The Product Catalog Management API provides a **standardized solution for rapidly adding partners’ products to an existing catalog**. It brings the capability for Service Providers to directly feed partners systems with the technical description of the products they propose to them. 

The **goals of this demonstration** with this specific use-case are to show how TAP ...
- ... speeds-up the development of new TM Forum Open API compatible services
- ... allows developers to be able to focus on delivering value to their users instead of caring about how their services will be deployed
- ... ensures only Open API compatible services that meet regulatory, security, and compliance requirements will be deployed 
- ... provides a full developer portal with for example API discovery and monitoring capabilities
